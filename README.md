# Traffic-analyzer
##Objective:
  To develop a C++ application that reads traffic data (e.g., vehicle logs) and provides analytics such as vehicle count, average speed, and classification of vehicles. This project will simulate a 
  basic traffic analysis system, which can be extended to more complex scenarios.
  Key Features:
  Data Input:

The program will read data from a file containing traffic logs. Each entry in the log could include details like timestamp, vehicle ID, speed, and type of vehicle.
Data Parsing:
